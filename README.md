# About the project
CircleLink is a one-stop-shop application that will provide an optimized and attractive loyalty system for medium and small businesses.
We developed an unique and affordable loyalty program enables the small scale businesses’ customers to get some points on every transaction they make. Also, CircleLink provides simple yet secure authentication system so that both customers and business owners can easily access their account. Furthermore, we create an “eco-system” between businesses & businesses and businesses & consumers, by designing a feature called “collborate system”.

# The development process
The project implemented GraphQL on top of Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. We also integrated Google OAuth to check for user's authentication. 

# My role
I am the project manager and full stack developer of the team. I am in charge of building the backend and deploying it using AWS - EC2.
